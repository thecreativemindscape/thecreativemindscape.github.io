<p>This is my Barbie doll collection given to to me as a gift from my mother. She brought these collectable dolls for me because she wanted me to be able to sell them 
  in the future. I've had these dolls since I was six years old in addition to other toys that weren't collectables.I've always cherished these dolls and maintain them by 
  keeping them enclosed in their boxes and stored away inside of my closet. <a href="https://creations.mattel.com/">Check out Mattel.com for more Barbie collectables!</a></p>
