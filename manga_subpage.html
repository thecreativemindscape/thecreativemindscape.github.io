  <p><h3>More About My Love for Anime</h3></p>
  
  
  
  <p>Over the years, I have watched a lot of anime but my favorite anime is Bleach.I have rewatched this anime several times and because I started watching it when I was a teenager I have an attachment to the characters. Recently, they came out with the Bleach TYBW (Thousand Year Blood War) where the characters are more mature and much more powerful, as apart of the audience I am excited to see how Ichigo (protagonist) defeats the antagonists in the show. <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/">Check out Barnes and Nobles for more manga!</a></p>
