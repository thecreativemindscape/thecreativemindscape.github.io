  <P>My name is Sandy Fougeres, I am a student at the New York City College of Technology where I major in Professional and Technical Writing. In 2017, I attended the NYC
    Comic Con where I got to see different people in anime cosplay and showcases of action figure collectables. This inspired as I was creating this website to mesh 
    together the two things I found super interesting at the event which was anime and collectable items (outside of the cosplay). I come from a family of collectors and 
    my mother started my very own collection of dolls when I was six years old.This website is to introduce people to anime and collectable items, so that they may feel
    motivated in starting their own collection journey or just checking out some anime.</p>
