  <p>My interest in collecting stems from my mother who gifted me collectable Barbie dolls as a child. Since then, I have sparked interest in collecting many different things, one of them is crochet yarn. Besides my mother sparking an interest of collecting within me, my aunt, Jennie, has too. She has many collectings ranging from fridge magnets to wine bottles. I hope to inspire my daugter to collect as I plan to improve or start new collections.</p>
