  <p>My name is Sandy Fougeres, I am a student at the New York City College of Technology where I major in Professional and Technical Writing. In 2017, I attended the NYC
    Comic Con where I got to see amazing cosplay and showcases of action figure collectables. That experience inspired me to make the creative mindscape collections, where 
    I find cool colletible items and showcase them online. I come from a family of people who love to collect things and my mother started my very own collection of Barbie dolls 
    when I was six years old. The love for collectibles have grown since, and this website is to introduce as well as spark interest in people who may be starting or looking to start 
    their own collector's journey.</p>
