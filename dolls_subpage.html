  <p><h3>More about my doll collection</h3></p> 
  



<p>My dolls were pruchased through the mattel website and originally my mother wanted to add more to the collection but decided to allow me time to grow and add to the collection myself. I recently checked out how much some of them are worth and learned that they have increased in price over the years but I decided I will add to my collection and pass it down to my own daughter . <a href="https://creations.mattel.com/">Check out Mattel.com for more Barbie collectables!</a></p>
